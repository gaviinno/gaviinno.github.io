Naturally, this first look at Grand Theft Auto 6 has revealed some new details about the game – including information on the GTA 6 location, characters, and gameplay. So keep on reading to find everything you need to know about GTA 6 so far.

# Are the GTA 6 leaks real?

There was an unprecedented GTA 6 leak on September 18, 2022, which saw dozens of videos and screenshots from an alleged in-development build of the game spread online. Are you wondering whether the GTA 6 leaks are real? Well, Rockstar has since issued a statement confirming the hack: "We recently suffered a network intrusion in which an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems, including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto."

"We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way," the Rockstar statement continues. "We will update everyone again soon and, of course, will properly introduce you to this next game when it's ready. We want to thank everyone for their ongoing support through this situation." 

In the 48 hours since the GTA 6 leak first appeared, the GTA Forums have worked to scrub all remnants of the illegally obtained screenshots and videos to avoid being "obliterated by Rockstar". The dedicated GTA 6 reddit has also taken all links, pictures, and videos of the leak offline, and has committed to staying online with one condition: "We will allow discussions related to the leak without attaching the leaks. We don't allow comments that has [sic] download links to the leak."

Since then, Rockstar and parent company Take-Two have spoken out about the leaks. In a recent earnings call, CEO of GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick said that the leak was "terribly unfortunate", before adding that "we take those sorts of incidents very seriously indeed". 

"There's no evidence that any material assets were taken, which is a good thing, and certainly the leak won't have any influence on development or anything of the sort. But it is terribly disappointing, and causes us to be ever more vigilant on matters relating to cybersecurity."

The latest update on all of this is that the teenager accused of massive GTA 6 leak has been deemed psychiatrically unfit for trial. Reuters reports that 18-year-old Arion Kurtaj, a member of the Lapsus$ hacking group has been assessed by psychiatrists who have deemed him unfit to stand trial for himself.

Interestingly, there's one leaked GTA 6 screenshot that is the sole survival of a Rockstar copyright "nuke". Seems like just a single frame has escaped the all-encompassing copyright claims Rockstar has waved across the internet. 

# GTA 6 release date: when is it coming out? Will GTA 6 be delayed again?

The GTA 6 release date is yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games. That hasn't stopped internet sleuths from making some educated guesses. Multiple sources have corroborated a rumor that GTA 6 will release in 2025, which was part of a larger info drop that suggested that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be set in a modern-day Vice City. It's always wise to approach this sort of speculation with caution, but with the new GTA 6 leaks appearing to confirm a modernized Vice City setting, perhaps a release sometime in 2025 is right on the money. 

Interestingly, Take-Two, the Rockstar owner, continues to imply GTA 6 is out by March 2025 while saying nothing about it. CEO Strauss Zelnick says "we remain confident that we are positioning our business for a significant inflection point in fiscal 2025, which we believe will include new record levels of operating performance." That significant boost to revenue predictions is supposedly due to the GTA 6 launch. 

TURNING TO THE CRYSTAL BALL FOR ANSWERS
GTA Online

I asked a psychic leading questions about the GTA 6 release date, and it was wonderfully weird

However, there are a few rumors that GTA 6 could launch in 2024. Initially, a Bloomberg article stated that  "current and former Rockstar staff reckon GTA 6 is still at least two years away from release, suggesting a 2024 launch." This was then backed up by Microsoft's latest response to the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into its ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 

In it, Microsoft wrote the following: "The highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be released in 2024."

So maybe the GTA 6 release date is closer than we expect?

As Rockstar is yet to release a GTA 6 trailer, it's difficult for us to say with certainty how this new game will play and how it will innovate on Grand Theft Auto 5. However, it's clear from the early development footage which leaked out that Rockstar is at least investigating and playtesting some new mechanics. For example, it appears that a new series of stealth mechanics are being introduced – with footage depicting characters crawling while prone, and even carrying bodies. 

Additionally, the weapon wheel – which was overhauled for GTA 5 – is returning in some capacity, and the leaked footage suggests that Rockstar is introducing new health buff items such as painkillers. We can also see that the Five Star 'Wanted' system is returning, and that the VCPD have improved AI routines for tracking Jason and Lucia after you get on their radar.
